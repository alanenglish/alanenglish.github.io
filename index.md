# about me

a recent graduate of dev bootcamp here in Chicago, i'm constantly enthralled in what i am truly passionate about - designing, creating and building beautiful things.

an entrepreneur with experience leading a company, currently working with the incredible founders at SwayBrand to help connect influencers and brands like never before.

i'd love to connect and hear about what you're working on.
